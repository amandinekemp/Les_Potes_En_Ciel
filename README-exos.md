## ➤ Concepts:

For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

* [Maze project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/917)

----------

## ➤ What’s this “Research & project approval”?:

Before starting any coding, you will need to research and define your portfolio project over the course of 3 weeks. In the first week, the Project Proposal will be approved, followed by the second week where the MVP will be defined, and finally presented as a collection of tasks on a Trello board.

This first part is focused on creating a Project Proposal and requires that a google Document is submitted for Manual Review by a technical staff member. Please take time to brainstorm, research, and explore what currently exists during this first phase.

## ➤ Examples of the past:

## ➤ Some things to think about:

**Role**
Within the team you are on, we encourage you to take on the challenges that will be relevant for you to speak about in your (eventual) job search. For example, if your project is an ride-sharing clone, and you want to be a front end engineer, then it’s important to take on challenges with accessibility, interactive elements and user-interface. Likewise, if you are interested in backend engineering, it will be important to architect the API endpoints, data modeling and performance.

**Scope**
There is always a risk that your project is too ambitious, or not ambitious enough. Each has its disadvantage. For this project, consider that it is much better to end up with something a bit smaller in scope that has undergone a couple (or at least one) iteration of deployment, testing and bug fixes. Documentation is also a big bonus!

**Novelty**
Each person and team is unique. We encourage you to bring a sense of individuality to your project, so that you can use it as a tool to speak about other aspects of yourself or your team. As an example, if a team wants to create a buy/sell marketplace app and they are both passionate about bicycling, they may want to focus their marketplace on bicycles exclusively so specific attributes can be defined to track the items.

**Note:** A professional project theme is a requirement. We recommend avoiding themes focused on religion, political parties and views, sexuality, sexual orientation, or illegal substances. If there is a specific reason you are passionate about a topic and would like to pursue it, please meet with a staff member to discuss. As an example, creating a platform to have open political discourse with a moderation feature would be acceptable. A site to promote all the representatives and voting history of a single political party would not be acceptable.


## ➤ No idea? we have some for you…:

If you don’t know what to build, we have some ideas for you:

* Create a web service that uses API (like a GitHub stats of an account, etc.)
* Import a rich data set, sanitize it, and create a website to visualize the data with interactive zoom and sliders
* Create a music recommender based on a set of ‘liked’ songs
* Write a game that can be played against another person or an AI
* Ship an Android app
* Create an IoT system
* Write an image compression algorithm
* Write a compiler
* Write your own Docker-like container service
* Create a “One click” to deploy a cluster of blockchain mining workers with a web page to report on its statistics
* Create a “One click” to deploy a cluster of servers hosting docker, with a web page where you can start containers on-demand

## ➤ Default Project:

If you do not have an idea, and do not submit a proposal or do not gain approval for your proposed projects, you’ll be expected to complete the 2D Game: The Maze - concept page available on top of this project.

## ➤ More Info:

**Manual QA Review**
Review and approval for your portfolio project must be done by a staff member.

## ➤ What’s the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?

“A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more.” – Wikipedia

Now that the team and the challenge are well defined, it is time to create a specification for the first version of your software. This is important because it is an opportunity to get the scope of the project right. If a project is too small in scope, it does not serve as an opportunity to expand your technical understanding, or present as impressive. When a project is too large in scope, the project will likely be incomplete by the end of the 2 weeks.

## ➤ Some things to think about:

**User Experience**
Remember that one of the most important users to consider will be the recruiter and hiring manager that will be evaluating your work. It may be helpful to think through a user experience that can be accessed without creating an account or giving personal details.

**Scope**
For this project, consider that it is better to end up with something a bit smaller in scope that has undergone a couple (or at least one) iteration of deployment, testing and bug fixes. Documentation is also a big bonus!

**Shortcuts**
It is fine to find ways to speed up development by taking shortcuts, but it’s important to state these openly, and have a plan in place to amend these if there is time. An example might be to first read and write from files without using a database (as you did with Airbnb at first), or hard-coding some values. This might be a good strategy if the real challenge of your software lies elsewhere, and you want to first create an end-to-end proof of concept to demonstrate feasibility.

## ➤ Default Project:

If you do not have an idea, and do not submit a proposal or do not gain approval for your proposed projects, you’ll be expected to complete the 2D Game: The Maze - concept page available on top of this project.

</p>

### 5. User Stories

First, research what [user stories](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/fAuAYAad8ElX8fU9VTt83g) are, and how to write them. Also note  [some pitfalls](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/GSC1ArZsSUI51fdMaTbDvw) of creating user stories that are too general.

In the “User Stories” section:

* Define 3-5 detailed user stories that will be satisfied when your MVP is complete.
 
### 6. Mockups

If there is any visual interface to your Portfolio Project, this section is required. If your project lives on the commandline, or in script, then do not include this section. Use a prototyping tool, like Balsamiq, to draft your user-facing visual interfaces.

In a section called “Mockups”:

<p align="center">
    <img [### 6. Mockups-image] src="https://github.com/amandinekemp/Les_Potes_En_Ciel/blob/feature/homepage-frontend/images/P2%20T6-mockups.png">

## ➤ Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

* [Maze project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/917)

## ➤ What’s a Portfolio Project?

The Portfolio Project will be a project you will showcase on your resumé, online, and during interviews. A completed Portfolio Project will consist of:

* A landing page describing your project
* A comprehensive README.md
* A demo of the project
* A presentation
* A blog post

## ➤ Why build a Portfolio project?

The Portfolio Project serves several different purposes:

1. Highlights a Student’s unique interests and background when networking, or interviewing with potential employers.
2. Provides a realistic workplace scenario where engineers create a solution to fit loosely defined requirements, break this down into concrete tasks and implement on a deadline.
3. Allows for self-directed learning to explore a new technical topic, deepen understanding of a curriculum-covered topic, or use technology to bring an idea to life.

## ➤ Timeline and checkpoints

Projects can be developed alone, or in teams of up to 3 students. The technologies and project concept are defined by the student teams.

Research & project approval (Part 1-3)

* Week 1: Project proposal (staff review, approval required)
* Week 2: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) proposal (staff review, approval required)
* **Week 3: [Trello](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/YBW0nPA4KlKweXMmM8uzQQ) board (staff review, approval required)**

Build Portfolio Project

* Week 4: Development
* Week 5: MVP completed (staff review, approval required)
* Week 6: Landing page deployed, final presentation delivered (staff review, approval required)

* Week 7: Blog post reflection (peer review)

## ➤ What’s the Trello board?

Trello is a free project management software that uses a kanban board to visually track the implementation of a feature set from “to-do” to “done”. Trello makes it easy to assign tasks, collaborate and collect notes in a central location.

There are other project management tools, such as Asana, Airtable, and Jira. Trello has been selected for ease of use and ability to visualize progress.

## ➤ Some things to think about

**Scope of tasks**
Creating well-scoped tasks is a skill that requires practice. Also explore creating subtasks within a task.

**Dependencies**
Some tasks will rely on other ones to first be completed. Other tasks can be done in parallel but may require integration with other components along the way. Define your tasks with dependencies in mind.

**Priority**
Similar to thinking about dependencies, it will also be important to complete the highest-risk part of your software first to ensure that the central workflows of your software can be completed. It may make sense to prioritize tasks that the team is least knowledgeable about, or require the greatest resources.

## ➤ Default Project

If you do not have an idea, and do not submit a proposal or do not gain approval for your proposed projects, you’ll be expected to complete the 2D Game: The Maze - concept page available on top of this project.

## ➤ More Info

Manual QA Review

It is your responsibility to request a review for your Trello board from a peer before the project’s deadline. If no peers have been reviewed, you should request a review from a staff member.

## ➤ Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

* [Portfolio Project Overview](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/916)
* [Maze project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/917)
* [3 Ways to Make a Portfolio Project Great](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/918)

## ➤ And now, we build!

This week is all about execution! You have a detailed plan and you’ve thought through many aspects of your project. Now, get to work and try to hit the goals you’ve set for yourself or your team. The deliverable for the upcoming week will be a status report to share the challenges and progress you’ve encountered this week.

## ➤ PLD: Portfolio Project Checkin

During the PLD this week, these are the objectives:

* Each team meets with 3 other teams, one at a time for 40 minutes.
* During the team-team meeting, each team presents for 20 minutes, then observes for 20 minutes.
* When a team is presenting, they share their proposal, problem statement, and walk through code any they’ve implemented and technical choices they have made.
* When a team is observing, they ask questions, share observations, and code review.

## ➤ Some things to think about

**Front-load the biggest challenges first**
This is the best time to tackle the areas you defined as the riskiest parts, and prioritizing them so that you can be confident that the project is feasible end-to-end. By taking this on first, it also allows for time to update your plan and rework your solution if necessary.

**Organize the collaboration**
If you’re working as a team, clarify the integration points, schedule and expectations. Frequent checkins, and co-locating to work in-person can be very effective.

**Implement specified branch strategy; merge often**
Merging code frequently is a great way to avoid a broken application the night before the presentation.

## ➤ Maze Project

If you are doing our Maze project, you can find all instructions in the Maze concept page

## ➤ More Info

**Manual QA Review**

Manual QA Reviews will be completed by staff members.
